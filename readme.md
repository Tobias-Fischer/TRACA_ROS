How to run?
0. essential library
0.a. matconvnet
0.b. piotr library
1. load 'demo_realtime.m' and modify MATCONV_PATH and PIOTR_PATH
2. copy all the networks included in 'TRACA/network/' of the original code.
3. run 'demo_realtime_ros.m'

Environment
Windows 10, MATLAB R2017b
I recommend to use matconvnet compiled with CuDNN for fast tracking.
